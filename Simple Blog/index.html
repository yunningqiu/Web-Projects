                     Debate: The Power of Language
                </h3>
                <p>We have all experienced a moment where we confront an issue and instantly, we have feelings of <em>apprehension</em>. Mixed feelings start to consume us as the mind tries to choose which argument is the best one to verbalize. I have always enjoyed penning my thoughts, creating structured arguments and sending off these cohesively developed ideas for others to listen but I would often find myself trapped in a whirlwind of emotions when exposed to a highly sensitive debate topic.
                </p>
                <p>Through these trainings, I have been trying to instill the core value of debate to my peers: <em>not only to debate for the truth, but more so for the thought.</em> Apart from being more aware of what is currently happening in the world, by conducting research and constantly debating about one topic, I realized that <strong>as a person, having an opinion is much more important than simply knowing the truth.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                In my eyes, debating simply is not to just argue about the facts but rather to listen, to think, to take everything with a grain of salt and to impart these feelings to others using my own power of language. Down the yellow brick road, I will see where this debating path leads, to me, and to the world around me.

                    Relooking at the World with Movie Dubbing
                </h3>
                <p>
                <i>&#8221;I had a cupucakee in the coppee shopo.&#8221; </i> Laughter echoed throughout the dining hall; Ten-ish people sat around the table, their bodies shaking, hand slapping the table, face rushed with redness. A girl was sitting at one side of the table, waving her hands, displaying various grimaces, trying to mimic different accents and dialects. Her face was full of frankness and soon burst out laughing as others started to cheer.
                </p>
                <p>
                I was told to be a good mimic since I was little. I always enjoy observing people&#8217;s characteristics when speaking: the tone they speak, the facial expressions they made, and their unique pronunciation of words. In addition to bringing laughter to people, <em>dubbing entitles me with better understanding towards a person by talking like him/her.</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                I gradually realized the significance of dubbing in <em>movie appreciation</em>. I feel closer to a character every time when I mimic his/her voice, and the emotions behind every word and pause become more appealing to me better than ever.
                </p>
                <p>
                Dubbing to me has gradually transferred from a pure entertaining activity to a skill that I want to do well in, not only for bringing laughter in this high-pressure season, but also for giving myself a break away from being a participant as <b>looking at the world with an objective eye, to discover people and their beauty.</b>
