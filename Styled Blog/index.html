			<h2> My Story </h2>
			<p>
				We have all experienced a moment where we confront an issue and instantly, we have feelings of <em>apprehension</em>. Mixed feelings start to consume us as the mind tries to choose which argument is the best one to verbalize. I have always enjoyed penning my thoughts, creating structured arguments and sending off these cohesively developed ideas for others to listen but I would often find myself trapped in a whirlwind of emotions when exposed to a highly sensitive debate topic.
			</p>
			<p>
				Founding the Debate Club in 2015 helped me cleanse my mind and guided me to better organize myself to construct logical arguments. No topic was off limits and I wanted my peers to feel the same sense of joy I had being a part of a team that worked out its mind with argumentative drills and syntactical tests. Evolving from my status as team member to mentor, this title change didnâ€™t translate to forgetting about the end-goal, which was to concurrently consume and share knowledge.
			</p>
			<p>
				As our debate club gets larger, more students have drastically improved their confidence, language skill, and ability to research, construct and present arguments . Debate has brought much more than I thought, to me and to the school. Aimed to spread the idea of debate in my community, we founded the Qingdao High School Debate Association(QDHSDA). Organizing voluntary debate training sessions and mock debates not only helps more teenagers who do not have the chance for advanced education to see their world in different perspectives, but also my participation made me realize the progress of imparting my knowledge to others and positively influencing them to be critical thinkers.
			</p>
			<p>
				Through these trainings, I have been trying to instill the core value of debate to my peers: <em>not only to debate for the truth, but more so for the thought.</em> Apart from being more aware of what is currently happening in the world, by conducting research and constantly debating about one topic, I realized that <strong>as a person, having an opinion is much more important than simply knowing the truth.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				In my eyes, debating simply is not to just argue about the facts but rather to listen, to think, to take everything with a grain of salt and to impart these feelings to others using my own power of language. Down the yellow brick road, I will see where this debating path leads, to me, and to the world around me.
